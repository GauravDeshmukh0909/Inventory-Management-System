# 🛒 Product Creation API — Inventory Management System

## 📌 Overview

This endpoint enables creation of products along with their initial inventory in a specified warehouse. It includes comprehensive validation, logging, error handling, and integrity checks. This README also documents the **original issues**, **final fixes**, and **production considerations**.

## ❗ Original Code Issues Analysis

### 1. 🚫 Input Validation Issues
- No checks for required fields
- No validation of data types (e.g., integers, strings)
- No format enforcement (e.g., SKU, price)

### 2. 🚨 Missing Error Handling
- Uncaught database exceptions
- No handling of duplicate SKUs
- No validation for invalid `warehouse_id`

### 3. ⚠️ Business Logic Flaws
- Product incorrectly tied to a single warehouse
- Allows duplicate inventory records for the same product and warehouse
- No check for warehouse existence

### 4. 🔐 Security Issues
- No authentication or authorization
- Potential SQL injection via ORM misuse
- No rate limiting

### 5. 🧩 Data Integrity Issues
- No rollback on partial failure
- Possibility of product creation without inventory
- No handling of unique constraint violations

### 6. 🧱 Missing Features
- No response schema or validation
- No application logging
- No proper use of HTTP status codes

## ADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENTS FOR PRODUCTION:

### 1. AUTHENTICATION & AUTHORIZATION
   - Add JWT token validation
   - Role-based permissions (who can create products?)
   - API key authentication for service-to-service calls

### 2. RATE LIMITING
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Different limits for different user types
